# Idea:
We are planning to build a app that can be helpful in case of any natural calamity or other SOS situation. We all Desire to have one click solution to everything. Also not everybody is well prepared with what to do with what to do in which kind of calamity. Also getting the accurate data feed and making it reach to people is always a problem in such situations.

We are Going to build a mobile app that is useful in a such situations. The App is simply a SOS button to be pressed on emergency. The App procures data from mobile like the location for a Geo-map plotting and a rapidfire images for the classification of the calamity. The Server then works on the latlong data form the mobiles to work on the estimation of area increment and warn the people beforehand that they are likely to be hit by this. Providing the general instruction for the calamity is a sidefeature.

This app can also be used to pass on the required data to the people like the nearest relief station or nearby people in distress. The general instruction can also be passed by the Government for the smooth fuctioning of the Relief.
